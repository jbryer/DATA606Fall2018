The solutions to the practice problems are at the end of the book and do not need to be handed in. Graded assignments should be typed (preferably using R Markdown) or neatly hand written and scanned. Data for the homework assignments, and for within the chapters too, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Fall2018/tree/master/Data/Data%20from%20openintro.org).
