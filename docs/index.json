	"content": " Chapter 1 - Introduction to Data Learning Objectives  Identify the type of variables (e.g. numerical or categorical; discrite or continuous; ordered or not ordered). Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. indepedent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another. Identify the four principles of experimental design and recognize their purposes: control any possible con- founders, randomize into treatment and control groups, replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeat- ing the experiment, and block any variables that might influence the response. Use appropriate visualizations for different types of data (e.g. histogram, barplot, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.). Use different measures of center and spread and be able to describe the robustness of different statistics. Describe the shape of distributions vis-à-vis histograms and boxplots. Create and intepret contingency and frequency tables (one- and two-way tables).  Assignments Homework OpenIntro Statistics\n Practice: 1.7 (available in R using the data(iris) command), 1.9, 1.23, 1.33, 1.55, 1.69 Graded: 1.8, 1.10, 1.28, 1.36, 1.48, 1.50, 1.56, 1.70  For 1.48, the following R code will create a vector scores that can be used to answer the question:\nscores \u0026lt;- c(57, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 78, 79, 79, 81, 81, 82, 83, 83, 88, 89, 94)  Lab 1 The labs are available in the DATA606 R package. To start the first lab, use the startLab function. This will copy the lab to your current working directory and rename the file according to your computer username (as returend by Sys.info()['user']). If this is incorrect, then either provide the file-prefix parameter to startLab, or rename the file after it has been copied.\nstartLab('Lab1')  Readings  OpenIntro Statistics slides ggplot2 - ggplot2 is an R package by Wickham that implements the grammer of graphics (Wilkinson, 2005) in R. I will frequently make use of the graphing framework throughout the course and is worth learning. Visualizing Likert Data - An R package for visualizing Likert scale data built on the ggplot2 framework. Quick-R base graphics - Covers many of the visualizations using R\u0026rsquo;s base graphics.  Videos OpenIntro provides a number of videos. You may find these helpful while reading the chapter.\nCase Study: Using Stents to Prevent Strokes\n Data Basics: Observations, Variable, and Data Matrices\n Data Collection Principles\n Observational Studies and Sampling Strategies\n Designing Experiments\n Summarizing and Graphing Numerical Data\n Exploring Categorical Data\n Using Randomization to Analyze a Gender Discrimination Study\n Note about Pie Charts There is only one pie chart in OpenIntro Statistics (Diez, Barr, \u0026amp; Çetinkaya-Rundel, 2015, p. 48). Consider the following three pie charts that represent the preference of five different colors. Is there a difference between the three pie charts? This is probably a difficult to answer.\nHowever, consider the bar plot below. Here, we cleary see there is a difference between the ratio of the three colors. As John Tukey famously said:\n There is no data that can be displayed in a pie chart that cannot better be displayed in some other type of chart\n Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart.\n"

In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see www.DAACS.net for more information). Our first meeting will be on Wednesday, September 5th. Couple of important notes as you get started:\n  Getting Started with R To get started with the labs, you will need to install R and other supporting applications. Links to download all the software is on the Software page at http://data606.net/software which is available on the Misc menu. Once you are in RStudio, you will need to install a number of R packages using the following two commands: install.packages(c(\u0026#39;openintro\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;OIdata\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;devtools\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;psych\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;reshape2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;knitr\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;markdown\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;shiny\u0026#39;)) devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;jbryer/DATA606\u0026quot;) Note that this course used to be listed as IS 606, hence the different package name.\n  "

We will use the chapter on Bayesian analysis.\n  Software We will make use of R, an open source statistics program and language. Be sure to install R and RStudio on your own computers within the first few days of the class. R - Windows or Mac RStudio - Download Windows or Mac version from here LaTeX - Windows use MiKTeX or Mac use BasicTeX (it is best to use Safari to download this file as Chrome or Firefox will often fail) If using Windows, you also need to download and install these:\n  Links These are some useful resources on the web for learning R.

Kabakoff\u0026rsquo;s website. Great reference along with his book, R in Action. O\u0026rsquo;Reilly Try R. Great tutorial on R where you can try R commands directly from the web browser.\n  Math Equations Occasionally you will need to type equations in homework and labs. R Markdown supports LaTeX style equations using the MathJax javascript library. I do not expect you to learn LaTeX for this course. Instead, I recommend using the free application [Daum Equation Editor](). It availabe online, as a Google Chrome Extension, or as a standalone Mac Application.

	"content": " Chapter 2 Learning Outcomes  Define trial, outcome, and sample space. Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.\n$$ E(X)=\\mu =\\sum { i=1 }^{ k }{ { x }{ i }P\\left( X={ x }_{ i } \\right) } $$ The variance of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each squared deviation of an outcome from the expected value weighted by its probability. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n$$ Var(X)={ \\sigma }^{ 2 }=\\sum { i=1 }^{ k }{ { \\left( { x }{ i }-\\mu \\right) }P\\left( X={ x }_{ i } \\right) } $$ The average of a linear combination of discrete random variables is computed as the sum of their averages, weighted by the constant multipliers. The variance of a linear combination of independent discrete random variables is computed as the sum of their variances, weighted by the square of the constant multipliers. The distribution of a continuous random variable is described by the probability density function. The total area under the density curve is 1. Probabilities under the density curve can be calculated as the area under the curve. The probability of a continuous random variable being exactly equal to a value is 0, since there is no area under the curve at a given location.

There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided in the templates. When submitting the assignments, include the R Markdown file (change the name to include your last name, for example Bryer-Proposal.Rmd and Bryer-Project.Rmd) along with any supplementary files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g. data files, screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be shared with others on this website so should be presented in a way that other students can reproduce your analysis.\nProject Proposal The proposal can be more informal using bullet points where necessary and include R code and output. You must address the following areas:\n Research question What are the cases, and how many are there? Describe the method of data collection. What type of study is this (observational/experiment)? Data Source: If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link. Response: What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)? Explanatory: What is the explanatory variable(s), and what type is it (numerical/categorival)? Relevant summary statistics  Example data project proposal (Source Rmarkdown file)\nFinal Project Format The final report should be presented in more formal format. Consider your audience to be non data analysts. Fellow data analysts (i.e. students) will be able to access your R Markdown file for details on the analysis. Submit a Zip file with your R Markdown file, the HTML output, and any supplementary files (e.g. data, figures, etc.). You must address the five following sections:\n Introduction: What is your research question? Why do you care? Why should others care?\n Data: Write about the data from your proposal in text form. Address the following points:\n Data collection: Describe how the data were collected. Cases: What are the cases? (Remember: case = units of observation or units of experiment) Variables: What are the two variables you will be studying? State the type of each variable. Type of study: What is the type of study, observational or an experiment? Explain how you\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design. Scope of inference - generalizability: Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not. Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability. Scope of inference - causality: Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not.  Exploratory data analysis: Perform relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.\n Inference: If your data fails some conditions and you can\u0026rsquo;t use a theoretical method, then you should use simulation. If you can use both methods, then you should use both methods. It is your responsibility to figure out the appropriate methodology.\n Check conditions Theoretical inference (if possible) - hypothesis test and confidence interval Simulation based inference - hypothesis test and confidence interval Brief description of methodology that reflects your conceptual understanding\n  Conclusion: Write a brief summary of your findings without repeating your statements from earlier. Also include a discussion of what you have learned about your research question and the data you collected. You may also want to include ideas for possible future research.\n  Data Sources You are not to use data sources used in class or the textbooks.

Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. indepedent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another.\n  Chapter 2 Chapter 2 Learning Outcomes Define trial, outcome, and sample space. Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.\n  Chapter 3 Chapter 3 Assignments Homework OpenIntro Statistics Practice: 3.1 (see normalPlot), 3.3, 3.17 (use qqnormsim from lab 3), 3.21, 3.37, 3.41 Graded: 3.2 (see normalPlot), 3.4, 3.18 (use qqnormsim from lab 3), 3.22, 3.38, 3.42 Lab The labs are available in the DATA606 R package.

In addition to teaching this course, I am an Executive Director at Excelsior College where I am currently working on a Department of Education grant to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (see www.DAACS.net for more information). Our first meeting will be on Wednesday, September 5th. Couple of important notes as you get started:\n The course syllabus is on Github here: data606.net I will post all course materials there. Blackboard will be used primarily for submitting assignments. Introduce yourself in the Getting Acquainted forum on Blackboard. Once you go through the syllabus, try starting Lab 0 as soon as you can. This will require you to install R and RStudioand will help get you get acquainted with R. The best way to reach me is by email at jason.bryer@gmail.com. If you would prefer to talk on the phone or setup a GoToMeeting session, it is best to suggest some times by email first. Our meetups will be on Wednesday from 8pm to 9pm. I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and a fantastic semester! Good luck!   "

Links to download all the software is on the Software page at http://data606.net/software which is available on the Misc menu. Once you are in RStudio, you will need to install a number of R packages using the following two commands:\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026#39;openintro\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;OIdata\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;devtools\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;ggplot2\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;psych\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;reshape2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;knitr\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;markdown\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;shiny\u0026#39;)) devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;jbryer/DATA606\u0026quot;) Note that this course used to be listed as IS 606, hence the different package name. The library command will load the package and the startLab function will:\nCreate a folder called Lab0 in the current working directory. Open the the RMarkdown file (note that the name should have your login name).  library(DATA606) startLab(\u0026#39;Lab0\u0026#39;) Note the Lab0 directory has been created.\nRStudio Files Panel\n If you click Lab0 that will take you into that folder where you will see the RMardkown file (.Rmd extension) along with all the supporting files. Under the More menu there is an option to Set As Working Directory, you will want to do this before working in the RMarkdown file.\nSetting Working Directory\n The console pane will always tell you what your current working directory is. Clicking the arrow icon will open that folder in the Files tab on the right. R will look for files and directories that do not have absolute paths (i.e. starting with C: on windows or / on Linux and Macs) relative to the working directory.\nWorking Directory\n "

	"content": " DATA606 - Fall 2018 Instructor: Jason Bryer, Ph.D.\nClass Meetup: Wednesday 8:00pm to 9:00pm\nOffice Hours: By appointment\nEmail: jason.bryer@gmail.com\nCourse Description This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered in this course. Each of these statistical concepts will be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios through the use of case studies and customized data sets.\nCourse Learning Outcomes: By then end of the course, students should be able to:\n Understand the foundations of probability theory and perform basic probability calculations. Build basic stochastic models for commonly encountered business problems. Model situations involving uncertainty using appropriate probability distributions and conditional techniques. Explore and summarize data using descriptive statistics. Test hypotheses using classical and modern computational techniques. Construct estimators and calculate intervals using classical and modern computational techniques. Perform basic Bayesian statistical techniques for estimation and testing hypotheses.  Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:  Business Understanding. Learn when probabilistic techniques apply to certain categories of business problems, discuss the sorts of solutions that are possible, and understand the limitations of these techniques. Foundational Math Skills. Explore and analyze data, build probabilistic and statistical models, construct estimators, and test hypotheses. Predictive Modeling. Learn foundational techniques that underlie predictive modeling algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes. Presentation. Complete and submit collaborative assignments using techniques from the course.  How is this course relevant for data analytics professionals? Probabilistic techniques are the foundation of many data science applications from data exploration and visualization to outlier analysis, stochastic modelling, and data mining algorithms. This course will ensure that students have a strong understanding of these foundations.\nGrading  Homework (16%) Labs (40%) Data Project (20%) Final exam (18%) Meetup Presentation (5%) Getting Aquainted (1%)  Grade Distribution    Quality of Performance Letter Grade Range % GPA     Excellent - work is of exceptional quality A 93 - 100 4   Excellent A- 90 - 92.9 3.7   Good - work is above average B+ 87 - 89.9 3.3   Satisfactory B 83 - 86.9 3   Below Average B- 80 - 82.9 2.7   Poor C+ 77 - 79.9 2.3   Poor C 70 - 76.9 2   Failure F \u0026lt; 70 0    How This Course Works: This course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments to be submitted. There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nMeetup presentations will comprise the solution and presentation to the class of one of the suggested problems for study from the weekly materials (not the graded homework problems). Each student must present one problem throughout the semester. Problems are chosen by entering your name and problem in the Google Spreadsheet. Note there is a maximum of three presentations per meetup and presentations should be no more than five minutes. Additionally, prepare your presentation so that the slides or document (I suggest using R Markdown) will be shared on the course website. Problems are assigned first come, first served, so any problem not already chosen by another student is available.\nFurther details on each of these assignments will be available in Blackboard and/or this Github repository.\nTextbooks Required Diez, D.M., Barr, C.D., \u0026amp; Çetinkaya-Rundel, M.
